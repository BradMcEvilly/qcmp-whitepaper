# Quantum-Conscious Memory Protection (QCMP)#
**Why Your AI Agent's Memory Is the New Attack Surface**

## **Abstract**

Here's the problem nobody wants to talk about: we're deploying autonomous AI agents at scale, connecting them to everything via MCP, and their memory systems are wide open. MINJA hits **98.2% injection success** using nothing but normal queries. AgentPoison needs less than 0.1% poisoned data to backdoor an agent with 80%+ reliability. I've spent the last year pulling threads from quantum biology, consciousness theory, and cryptography to build something different. Not another detection layer. A protection architecture that treats memory integrity the way we should have from the start—as the cognitive foundation everything else depends on.

**Keywords:** MCP security, memory poisoning, agentic AI, post-quantum cryptography, consciousness metrics

## **Implementation**

## Latest Work
- **[QCMP Whitepaper](https://github.com/bradmcevilly/qcmp-whitepaper)**: Mitigating 98%+ memory poisoning in MCP agents. arXiv cs.AI sub pending—endorsements welcome!
- DeepGuard-MCP: Runtime MCP firewall (coming soon).

## Focus Areas
- Agentic AI Security (OWASP Top 10 LLM)
- Post-Quantum Crypto (ML-KEM integrations)
- Consciousness-Inspired Metrics (IIT Φ for coherence)

With 25+ years in enterprise AI, cloud security, and quantum systems, Brad leads DeepSweep.ai in building runtime protections for agentic AI. This whitepaper draws from his work on MCP vulnerabilities and interdisciplinary insights.

## **Feedback & Endorsement**

Feedback welcome on the QCMP framework, metrics (e.g., CCI/NIS thresholds), or quantum-bio integrations\! If you're active in cs.AI (4+ recent arXiv subs), an endorsement for my first submission would be huge—DM or comment with your thoughts. Let's secure agent memory before it's too late.
